# SL_german.0 // startup_german

# Startup event to enforce cultural sanity with regard to SWMH's german/dutch
# cultural melt and its multiple melt dates
#
# Catches cases where a character's culture should be converted to a newer one
# or to an older one (only occurs due to historical lowborns / dynasties omitted
# from culture-melt's rules).
#
# E.g., there should be no "high germans" (culture=german) before 1170.1.1, yet
# there most certainly are miscellaneous instances in the character history
# wherein this is the case.
#
# Thus, we provide sane defaults for all "impossible" cases, and we try to make
# smart choices about cultural conversion of older characters with 'old-style'
# cultures at post-melt start dates.
#
# The [planned] dynamic melting pot event chains will catch the latter cases,
# but we want as many qualifying characters to reflect the proper culture
# for their start date as possible before the user even loads the game.
# Thus, for converting to post-melt cultures at startup, we can actually just
# trigger parts of those dynamic event chains statically upon startup to
# consistently apply the same melt logic as we do dynamically and reuse a
# great deal of fairly complex code. [TODO]
